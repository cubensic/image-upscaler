# TODO List for Image Upscaling Web App

**üèÜ MVP ACHIEVED & DEPLOYED WITH REAL AI! üéâ**

This initial phase focused on building a fully functional Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for the AI Image Upscaler, from local development to a live Vercel deployment, including integration with a real third-party AI service (Replicate.com).

**Key Achievements:**
- Complete application architecture (FastAPI backend, Vanilla JS frontend).
- Robust file upload and validation (client and server-side).
- Successful integration with Replicate.com for actual AI image upscaling.
- Comprehensive automated testing suite (API and service layer).
- Seamless deployment to Vercel with environment variable configuration.
- Clean, maintainable, and well-structured codebase.

    - [x] Loaded Replicate API token and model ID from environment variables.
    - [x] Sent image data to Replicate's `nightmareai/real-esrgan` model.
    - [x] Handled `FileOutput` object from Replicate SDK.
    - [x] Retrieved and returned the upscaled image.
  - [x] Return binary PNG image with `200 OK`
- [x] Add console logging for:
  - [x] Incoming requests
  - [x] Validation failures
  - [x] AI processing steps (request, response, errors)
- [x] Implement `/api/health` endpoint indicating AI service availability.
- [x] Configure CORS.
- [x] Load environment variables using `python-dotenv`.

## 4. Frontend Implementation
### 4.1 index.html
- [x] Basic HTML5 skeleton
- [x] Include dropzone container, status area, result viewer, notification banner
- [x] Link `styles.css` and `script.js`

### 4.2 styles.css
- [x] Centered, responsive layout
- [x] Styles for:
  - [x] Drop zone (hover, active states)
  - [x] Progress indicator
  - [x] Notification banner (error/success colors)
  - [x] Result viewer & download button

### 4.3 script.js
- [x] Implement **DragDropZone**:
  - [x] Handle `dragenter`/`dragleave`/`drop`
  - [x] Fallback click-to-select `<input type="file">`
- [x] Client-side validation:
  - [x] File type
  - [x] File size ‚â§ 5 MB
  - [x] Show inline errors via NotificationBanner
- [x] Implement **ProgressIndicator**:
  - [x] States: idle, uploading, processing, done
- [x] POST to `/api/upscale` using Fetch API:
  - [x] Send `FormData` with `image`
  - [x] Handle binary response as Blob
- [x] Implement **ResultViewer**:
  - [x] Display original and upscaled images side-by-side

  - [x] "Upload Another" button to reset the app
- [x] Implement **NotificationBanner** for:
  - [x] Validation errors

  - [x] Upload unsupported type ‚Üí 400
  - [x] Upload too large ‚Üí 400
  - [x] Upload valid file ‚Üí 200 + correct `Content-Type`

- [x] Define environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
  - [x] `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN`
  - [x] `AI_UPSCALE_MODEL`
  - [x] `MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB`

  - [x] API Endpoints
  - [x] Frontend Components
  - [x] Current Status (MVP with Real AI)
  - [x] Next Steps (from README)

## 8. Next Steps / Future Enhancements (From README & Spec)
- [ ] **Scaling Options**: Add 2x, 4x (current default), 8x upscaling factor selection in UI and backend.
- [ ] **Enhanced UI**: Add before/after slider comparison for images.
- [ ] **Caching**: Implement result caching for improved performance (e.g., for frequently upscaled images or to avoid re-processing if user uploads same image).
- [ ] **Authentication**: Add user accounts and usage tracking (if app were to scale).
- [ ] **More Advanced Error Handling**: More granular error messages for specific AI API failures.
- [ ] **Configuration for different AI models**: Allow selection or configuration of different upscaling models via environment variables or UI.
- [ ] **Frontend Unit Tests**: Introduce simple unit tests for frontend logic (e.g., file validation).
